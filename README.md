PayDay supports students' counting money goals.


Run Payday.html by right clicking, and "open with google chrome" OR "safari." Any web browser should work.


To edit PayDay, right click on Payday.html, and open with a code editor, such as "Atom." This is a free program that you can download. 


There is a copy of payday.html that you can use if you don't know how to correct an error.
